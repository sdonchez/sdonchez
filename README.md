# Hi, I'm Stephen Donchez
## A computer engineer, but a whole lot more
 My degree says I have a bachelor's of science in Computer Engineering and a minor in Computer Science. But that's just a small part of who I am. Sure, I'm passionate about embedded systems, and am looking forward to putting my knowledge of software development, FPGAs, and the latest in embedded security to work. But I'm also a 3rd degree black belt, a live event technician with 4 years experience in Audio, Video, and Lighting for events of all sizes, and an avid ball-thrower whenever my dog asks. [I encourage you to take a moment to explore who I am (in digital form), and to reach out with any questions!](https://sdonchez.engineer/#/)
