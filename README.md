# Hi, I'm Stephen Donchez
## A Systems engineer, but a whole lot more
On paper, I'm a Systems Engineer with a Bachelors and a Masters in Computer Engineering and a minor in Computer Science. But that's just a small part of who I am. Sure, I'm passionate about embedded systems, and am excited to be putting my knowledge of software development, FPGAs, and the latest in embedded security to work. But I'm also a 4th degree black belt, have 6 years of experience as a live event technician working in Audio, Video, and Lighting for events of all sizes, and an avid ball-thrower whenever my dog asks. [I encourage you to take a moment to explore who I am (in digital form), and to reach out with any questions!](https://sdonchez.engineer/#/)
